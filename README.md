# ai-social

We talk only about AIs

> npm create social --template-ai-social

## Current Status

1. AI cost too much, most VC can't affort base AI development
2. Hullication is hard to avoid, system messages are breakable

## Expect something in the future

1. The GAI will be real soon, eg, we have self drive car now!
2. But it would take time to be perfect (eg everyone want to have their own style of of Car! Think about the hourse, not everyone would are holding hourse now)

## Potential projects we can do

1. Build an affortable base AI that could be customized/expert in certain domain,
eg Adidas AI shouldn't share anything about Nike or other compatitors (it actually just human report;
10 yrs ago, there are full of bugs and security issues; software development in dustry is much stable nowadays!)
2. Focusing on cretive industry; people won't care if fewthings are missleading...)
3. AI control ability, eg could able to connect with human at any time? eg AI and human combination?
